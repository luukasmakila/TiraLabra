# Neural network to recognize digits

Implementing a neural network to recognize handwritten digits.

## Dependencies & Running
Install Python on your computer.

Run the following to install the dependencies:
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the following to start the program:
```console
python demo.py
```

Let the program train the model and once the training is done, a window will pop up where you can start visualizing the networks predicitions against the real labels. To see the next prediction, close the current image via the "x" button and then the next prediction will pop up.

Architecture of the network and other hyperparameters can be modified in the demo.py file.
