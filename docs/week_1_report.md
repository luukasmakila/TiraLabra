# Week 1

## What has been going on?
- Learning about the topic. What is a neural network, how it's made, what it consists of etc (see spec_doc.md).
- Figuring out how to approach the project from a coding perspective.

## Plans for next week?
- Begin coding the actual project, starting with a class named NeuralNetwork.
- Goal is to have a setup where a neural network can be formed and have some of the other methods done aswell.
