# Week 4

## What has been going on?
- Got the model working properly.
- Model evaluation, tweaking hyperparameters. Best result so far is 97.44% accuracy against unseen data.
- Added the "visualize" method. This method visualizes the predictions of the neural network. It shows the input (X), prediction and also the label.


## Plans for next week?
- Finish testing & improve documentation.
- Do analysis on the different hyperparameters and visualize these findings using matplotlib.
